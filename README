This project is a simple command-line Secret Code Generator that allows users to encode and decode messages using a Caesar cipher. The program offers a menu for users to choose between encoding, decoding, or exiting the program. It supports both uppercase and lowercase letters and skips non-alphabetic characters such as spaces and punctuation.

Features:
Encode a message: Shift each letter of the message forward by a user-defined number.
Decode a message: Reverse the shift to decode the message back to its original form.
Handle Uppercase and Lowercase: Properly encodes and decodes both letter cases.
User-friendly menu: Easily navigate between encoding, decoding, and exiting.
Edge case handling: Correctly wraps around the alphabet and ignores non-letter characters.
